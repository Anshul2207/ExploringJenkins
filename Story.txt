Intro:
This file is for story. A story of development of office 365 connector plugin for Jenkins.

Prologue:
It all started with development of Jenkins connector for Office365. For this connector to work, we needed a plugin in the Jenkins software which can send data to this connector.

The testing is going on. Things are not working and I don't know why! I am trying to find out, but am not getting why Jenkins is not calling my event but is calling Slacks! I am trying all different stuffs.


As expected nothing worked till I came back from Badminton.

Hurrah!!! Everytings working....

New story begins.....

The story of testing the connector...
