Intro:
This project is to explore Jenkins.

Things trying to findout are:
1. Git checkin triggering Jenkins build.
2. Testing Office 365 Connector if it sends author name when a git commit is made in success.

Now the story time.
The testing is going on. Things are not working and I don't know why! I am trying to find out, but am not getting why Jenkins is not calling my event but is calling Slacks! I am trying all different stuffs.

As expected nothing worked till I came back from Badminton.
